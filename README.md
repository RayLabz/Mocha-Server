# Mocha
A lightweight, multi-threaded, client-server library for Java

Mocha is a lightweight, multi-threaded client-server library for Java. It enables the quick creation
of multi-client, multi-port TCP and UDP clients and servers with minimal overhead. Mocha allows you to quickly
set up and run TCP and UDP servers as well as TCP, UDP, and WebSocket clients. By using
Mocha, you can avoid dealing with low-level networking technologies and protocols, instead concentrating
on business logic of your server.
